Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will.
In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way.
Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.
Always two there are, no more, no less. A master and an apprentice.
In the end, cowards are those who follow the dark side.
