# Lab 2: React!
We are making this lab easier. You all have worked really hard this semester, and I know you have a lot of other important things going on. Take a break :)

## A. React Setup
We will be following the tutorials on [the react page](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). Please also install [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en), which combined with the `Inspect` window, can be very helpful.

## B. React Tutorial
Follow the [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). You should use `Setup Option 2: Local Development Environment` and create the react app **inside** this folder. This way, when you commit we get to see all your code!

You should write the code on your own, even though Facebook has provided all the answers. We won't check too hard, but your code should not be an exact copy of whatever Facebook had :)

## C. Commit and celebrate!
Commit your changes and write a message of celebration! Take a screenshot of the product or a selfie of you with your tic tac toe game. Then, take a break :)
